# Software architecture

## Layer structure

The application conforms to three layered architectural design:

*Image*

Package _ui_ comprises of the graphical user interface logic, _services_ implement the application logic, and _functions_ contain the storage and upload functions. The package _entities_ contain the main application class objects.

(note: as of 23.11.2020 the application is converging towards the design but does not yet fully reflect it).
